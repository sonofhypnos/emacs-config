#+TITLE: Doom Configuration

Welcome to my emacs configuration. I'd discourage to just fork this configuration (there are a lot of things rather specific to my workflow, so that would just be shooting yourself in the foot). Feel free to copy what seems useful to you though.

* Installation
Upon reinstalling this on your system, you should make sure that important dependencies for emacs are working. Those are:
- ripgrep
- python lsp servers
